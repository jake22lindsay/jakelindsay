To do:

HEADER: no logo, just name, contact info maybe

UPPER: 
- Main/small text elements: move to center. Take out of main-space? then shift that whole div up?
- move all

PROJECTS:
- add projects section... discuss website

RESUME:
- 

SNAKE:
- write words function
- test out smaller scaled snake
- if snake not moving, stop render
- only move front and back of snake
- randomly generate start position

Current:
- move all text into its own container that will be fixed to the top. Resume will naturally
    fall below the fold because I'll set the height of the main and small text to be
    100vh.
- make it so that the resume pieces slide in from the right and left on-scroll. Once they become visible
- remove header logo, just "Jake Lindsay" in italics maybe
- main text will become a sentence with a rotating end... maybe no small text




Change Log:
- get fucked I'm way begind on this sucker
